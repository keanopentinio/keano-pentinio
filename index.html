                <h2>Volleyball</h2>
                <p>Everybody has different hobbies that they like to do for fun or just to relax. There are many kind of activities like football, basketball, swimming, or baseball. It all depends on each personality. For me, volleyball is my favorite hobby because it's part of my life and I can not live without it. When I play volleyball I feel healthy and stronger, besides I meet new people from the neighbor. I not only like playing volleyball but I also enjoy watching volleyball on T.V. when I go to the beach, my family and friends get together to play and we have a lot of fun. For me, volleyball is a part of my life and it means a lot to me.  </p>

                <h2>Cooking</h2>
                <p>Cooking is a necessity for everyone. Everyone in their life time needs to learn how to cook because cooking makes food taste better. Without cooking, everyone would eat raw fruits, vegetables etc. I am still learning how to cook but I consider it my hobby. Cooking is my hobby because I can spend time with my family.</p>

                <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
                <p>I love watching different kinds of movies whenever I am free. I can spend my leisure time watching it. On the one side, watching movies is a fun activity and on the other side, it is informative.

                    There are many social platforms where you can easily watch a movie and you can also rent a film and enjoy it. If you watch an educational movie, you will get to learn many things in your free time as well. Watching movies is full of enjoyment to me and it also enriches me with knowledge. </p>

                    <p>"Every new friend is a new adventure, the start of new memories". because of volleyball I had friends that I could socialize with playing volleyball. The team riverside is a reason why I made a new friend who travels to different places such as the one day league in Soro soro, Batangas where I am one of the expectations of our team. I was their open hitter with every hit there was a thrill and also because of the help of my teammates we reached the championship where we won the match unexpectedly.</p>

                    <h3>Barangay 20, Arieta Volleyball League</h3>
                    <p>On the volleyball court, the action can happen quickly and furiously, but in order for the team to succeed, each volleyball player must be an expert at their own position. To succeed, each player on a squad needs to possess a specific set of abilities. There are many challenges and moments of stress that I face in volleyball as one of the team's trusted players to win every game we play, particularly when I play for the team Elite Panthers, where we won the championship and I was able to join the mythical six to the help and support of my teammates.</p>

                    <p>As they say "A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal". As a volleyball player we also help a lot of people. Just these past few days where there was a play for cause (odl) in Barangay Simlong, Batangas City where the contribution of each player will be given to one of our friends who had an illness or blood disease (leukemia) and our circle of friends talked about joining. And here in the one day league we became a champion and I became you MVP(Most Valuable Player) and best outside spiker.</p>
